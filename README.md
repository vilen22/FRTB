MAR30-33 - Calculation of RWA for market risk

https://www.bis.org/basel_framework/standard/MAR?tldate=20240128

Value at risk (VaR) and expected shortfall (ES) risk measures lie at the heart of the market risk capital calculations. 
Banks that are subject to the market risk rule and/or Basel accords need to estimate and report these risk measures on a daily basis. 
There are a number of parametric, semi-parametric, and non-parametric estimators that can be utilized for VaR and ES estimation. 

In this project we will demonstrate that the nonparametric estimators of VaR and ES have large
asymptotic variance relative to the optimal parametric estimators that can be constructed
when the shape of the underlying distribution can be accurately modeled. This brings
the modeler to a statistical dilemma - use a nonparametric estimator and pay a high cost
of having large confidence intervals or take some model risk and work with significantly
tighter confidence intervals provided by the fitted model. 

The non-parametric estimators (such as sample VaR) are commonly used by the practitioners.  
We will present robust semi-parametric VaR and ES estimators that outperform the standard ones. These estimators will lead to more stable market risk capital calculations.
